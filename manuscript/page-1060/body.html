In my whole ride, with the exception of some boys brought up by Englishmen, I saw only one other party.

It is said that numbers of their children invariably perish in very early infancy from the effects of their wandering life; and as the difficulty of procuring food increases, so must their wandering habits increase; and hence the population, without any apparent deaths from famine, is repressed in a manner extremely sudden compared to what happens in civilized countries, where the father, though in adding to his labour he may injure himself, does not destroy his offspring.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Besides the several evident causes of destruction, there appears to be some more mysterious agency</p></div> </div>
