I believe a small tribe in Banda Oriental must be excepted; but they are widely separated from the Pampas Indians, and border close on those tribes that inhabit the forest, and live on foot. It appears, therefore, that these arrow-heads are antiquarian  relics of the Indians, before the great change in habits consequent on the introduction of the horse into South America.</p></div> </div>
