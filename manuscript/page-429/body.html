The evidence of rarity preceding extinction, is more striking in the successive tertiary strata, as remarked by several able observers; it has often been found that a shell very common in a tertiary stratum is now most rare, and has even long been thought extinct. If then, as appears probable, species first become rare and then extinctâ€”if the too rapid increase of every species, even the most favoured, is steadily checked, as we must admit, though</p></div> </div>
