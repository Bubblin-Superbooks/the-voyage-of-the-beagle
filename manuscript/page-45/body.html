Cuvier doubts whether the Diodon in this position is able to swim; but not only can it thus move forward in a straight line, but it can turn round to either side. This latter movement is effected solely by the aid of the pectoral fins; the tail being collapsed, and not used. From the body being buoyed up with so much air, the branchial openings are out of water, but a stream drawn in by the mouth constantly flows through them.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The fish, having remained in this distended state for a short time, generally expelled the air and water with considerable force from the branchial apertures and mouth.

This Diodon possessed several means of defence. It could give a severe bite, and could eject water</p></div> </div>
