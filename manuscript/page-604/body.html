Kendall  found the bay, in which he was at anchor, beginning to freeze at a period corresponding with our 8th of September.

It is a singular fact, that on the two great continents in the northern hemisphere (but not in the broken land of Europe between them ), we have the zone of perpetually frozen under-soil in a low latitudeâ€”namely, in 56 degs. in North America at the depth of three feet,  and in 62</p></div> </div>
